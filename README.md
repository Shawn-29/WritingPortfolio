# Shawn Fenner - Writing Portfolio

This repository contains four directories, each containing several written compositions from my academic career. All files are in Word (.docx) format.

## Progress Reports
During the summer semester of my senior year in college, I developed a video game in the Python Programming language. This directory contains my initial proposition for the project (CourseThoughts.docx), including project functionality, why I chose Python, learning objectives, and links to numerous resources.

Also included are three different progress reports, which I wrote to document the project's status as its development progressed. Each report also details Python-related concepts I learned during the semester and code samples I wrote to demonstrate my understanding using them.

## Research
My research topic involved the ongoing concern of mobile data privacy. Included herin are an annotated bibliography, an argument essay, and a final research report.

## Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document
An SRS document detailing project scope, business requirements, use cases, and hardware dependencies for the mobile book database management application, "Turbo Book Manager."
